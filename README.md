# What is this Project?

This is my approach on the "Wine Dataset for Clustering". 

The objective here is to try and cluster wine samples into three different categories (more on that on the next section). 

This project consists in a jupyter notebook with complete EDA explanation.

# About the dataset

This dataset is adapted from the Wine Data Set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine by removing the information about the types of wine for unsupervised learning.

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.
